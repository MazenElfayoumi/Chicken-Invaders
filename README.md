# Chicken Invaders Game

This project is a C++ implementation of a Chicken Invaders-style game. Players control a spaceship, navigating through the battlefield to shoot down waves of invading chickens. The game features a simple graphical interface using ASCII characters, and offers a fun, retro gaming experience.

## Features:
- **Spaceship Control**: Navigate your spaceship left and right to dodge incoming attacks and position yourself for optimal shooting.
- **Shooting Mechanism**: Fire bullets at the invading chickens using the spacebar, aiming to clear all waves.
- **Randomized Chicken Attack**: Chickens attack randomly, keeping the gameplay unpredictable and challenging.
- **Game Over Detection**: The game ends if your spaceship is hit by a chicken, displaying a "Game Over" screen.

## Controls:
- **Move Left**: Press `A` or `Left Arrow Key`
- **Move Right**: Press `D` or `Right Arrow Key`
- **Shoot**: Press `Spacebar`

## How to Play:
1. Start the game and choose the "Start Game" option.
2. Use the controls to navigate your spaceship and shoot down all the chickens.
3. Avoid getting hit by the chickens' attacks.
4. Clear all waves of chickens to win the game!

## Getting Started:
- Compile and run the game using a C++ compiler on a Windows machine.
- The game runs in the console, with simple ASCII graphics.

## Additional Information:
- This game uses the Windows API for handling console output and keyboard input.
- The code is modular, with functions dedicated to drawing the game board, handling player input, and managing game logic.
